# 6.9.2-RME Firmware

The maintained RME release lines are now 6.9.2-RME and 6.10.3-RME.
This replaces 6.9.0-RME for this line; older releases remain available.

## Changes

- Integrate upstream v6.9.2: restored PVA/BVOH presets, gantry squareness calibration (M1988), dock-calibration crash fixes and tool-parking/homing fixes.
- Preserve RME material-family EEPROM compatibility with upstream sparse preset indexing; remote reports retain stable preset slots.
- Preserve RME serial printing, lighting, adaptive mesh, PA cache,
  flexible-material handling, SpoolJoin preparation and verified firmware identity.
- Companion RME Compatibility b121 includes manual GitHub firmware synchronization
  and lazy-loaded settings. Firmware discovery uses the included manifest;
  downloading an update never automatically flashes it.

## Availability and validation

- Release images: CORE One INDX.
- Built source: `92153229c`. Later documentation commits do not change binaries.
- RME source regression checks passed for serial pages, lighting lifecycle,
  INDX parking/E resets, load metadata, PA persistence and SpoolJoin preparation.
- Build success is not physical-printer certification. Tool pickup, calibration,
  flexible-filament extrusion and flashing still require hardware validation.

Prusa's official upstream 6.9.2 release targets CORE One INDX.
RME adaptations are custom firmware; select the image matching your machine.
Included `rme-firmware-manifest.json` records verified BBF/application SHA-256
identities.
